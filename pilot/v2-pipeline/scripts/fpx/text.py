"""Stage 2, text layer: native PDF text, OCR on rasters, and a first role for each text item.

OCR (ocr()) runs the detector per tile of the upright image, plus a detection-only pass on the image rotated by 90
degrees and reduced (cfg.ocr_rotated_scale): the detector finds vertical dimension strings as horizontal text there,
while on the upright image it misses a third of them. Every box is then recognised once, in one batched call; a box
taller than wide holds vertical text and is recognised rotated clockwise and counter-clockwise, the better score
wins (vertical numbers are misread without the rotation). The earlier whole-image OCR at 90 degrees (every tile
detected, classified and recognised twice) is gone. The engine's own confidence filter is not applied;
cfg.ocr_min_conf is the one threshold."""
