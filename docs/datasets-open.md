# Public Datasets for Floor Plan Extraction

*Research catalogue · October 2026 · Public datasets for training and evaluating structured floor plan extraction, with licence verdicts and recommended use for BBL. Methods, models and paper-by-paper findings are in the [literature review and state of the art](literature-review.md), tools in [solutions](solutions-closed.md). Bracketed numbers refer to the shared [source list](papers/sources.md).*

## 1. Scope and Method

**Corpus.** About 60 datasets and data sources in nine groups: vector CAD drawings, raster floor plans, vector layouts and graphs, historical and style-diverse plans, BIM/IFC models, text in drawings, synthetic data, VLM benchmarks, and 3D reconstruction. They come from three places:
- the datasets used or introduced in the 32 papers of the [research index](papers/README.md);
- the dataset table now in [literature review §7](literature-review.md#7-datasets), and an earlier survey draft, which lists no further datasets;
- a web search (October 2026) for what both miss, focused on historical and non-residential plans, permissively licensed BIM models, text in drawings and 2025–2026 releases.

**Method.** For each dataset we recorded content and annotations, format, scale, building type and region, licence, access and current status. Licences and availability were checked against primary sources in October 2026: LICENSE files, dataset cards and records on Zenodo, Kaggle, Hugging Face and 4TU, terms of use, and the papers. Rows marked "not re-checked" rely on the papers or earlier catalogues only.

**Conventions.**
- Tables use Dataset (linked) | Content and annotations | Format | Scale and building type | Licence | Access and status | Limitations | Relevance.
- Licence verdicts follow the stated licence: P = permissive, commercial use allowed with attribution; SA = share-alike; ND = no derivatives; NC = non-commercial; R = research or academic use only, by request or agreement; U = unclear or conflicting.
- Relevance: High = licence-clean training source, or key test set for BBL's building types and graphical styles. Medium = useful benchmark, test set or partial training source that needs a licence review or major adaptation. Low = wrong domain, too small, not available, or the licence rules out use.
- Training means data that may end up in production weights. Benchmark means internal evaluation only, never in production weights. Weights trained on NC or R data are treated as unusable for production federal work without legal review ([literature review §11](literature-review.md#11-limitations-of-this-review)).

**Quality of the evidence.**
- Mirrors and derivatives often state a looser licence than the original (§5).
- Producers contradict themselves. CVC-FP's page names "Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (CC BY-NC 4.0)"; ResPlan is CC BY 4.0 on GitHub and CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 on Kaggle.
- Sizes differ between versions and papers: FloorPlanCAD 11,602 or 15,663 drawings, LS-CAD 45 or 50 plans, ZInD 1,524 or 1,575 homes, WAFFLE 18,556 plans or "nearly 20K" images.

## 2. Key Findings

1. **No public dataset fits BBL's core case.** None combines office, administrative or historical buildings, room stamps with number, usage and area, German, French or Italian text, and scanned or hand-drawn styles under a permissive licence. Training data has to come from BBL's own compliant DWGs, Swiss Dwellings and rendered models, with synthetic room stamps.
2. **Swiss Dwellings remains the backbone.** Version 3.0.0 (Zenodo, March 2023, CC BY 4.0) is still the latest version found: over 45,000 apartments in about 3,100 buildings, metric geometry including columns, and unit usage that includes commercial, public and janitor areas.\[101\] It is already in `data/public/` and feeds the pilot v2 segmenter.
3. **Non-residential plans and columns exist only in non-commercial CAD datasets.**
   - FloorPlanCAD (CC BY-NC 4.0) covers offices, schools, hospitals and malls, but has been frozen since the project shut down in early 2022.\[6\]
   - ArchCAD is mostly public and commercial buildings and has column classes, but is CC BY-NC 4.0, gated, and only 40K of its 413K samples are public. Identifiable text was removed.\[26\]\[28\]\[29\]
4. **Permissively licensed IFC models are the main untapped source.** IFC-Bench collects 51 IFC models from 22 projects, including offices, a dental clinic and a hospital, mostly under CC BY 4.0 or MIT.\[118\] The buildingSMART community samples are CC BY 4.0.\[115\] Rendered to plans in randomised styles, they give exact labels for walls, doors, windows, columns, stairs and named spaces. They add diversity, not volume.
5. **Several licences are stricter than catalogued so far.**
   - ResPlan: CC BY 4.0 on GitHub, CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 on Kaggle, built from scraped real-estate listings.\[103\]\[104\]
   - CVC-FP: non-commercial, despite a CC BY 4.0 name on its page.\[108\]
   - LIFULL HOME'S, the basis of R2V and Raster-to-Graph: "Only universities or public research institutions are eligible to be a User".\[107\]
   - ArchCAD: CC BY-NC 4.0 and gated; its code carries an "Academic License".\[26\]\[28\]
6. **Mirrors are not a licence source.** Copies of CubiCasa5K, CVC-FP, MLSTRUCT-FP and MSD on Kaggle, Roboflow, Hugging Face, figshare and Zenodo state licences that the originals do not grant (§5).
7. **Style-robustness tests rely on restricted data.** The public options are WAFFLE (Wikimedia, per-image licences), Versailles-FP (500 historical plans, academic use), CVC-FP (122 scans, NC) and MLSTRUCT-FP (dataset terms not stated). A held-out BBL gold set remains essential ([pipeline §8](pipeline.md#8-evaluation)).
8. **Text in drawings is not covered.** No public dataset has room stamps with ground truth, and this search found no OCR benchmark for architectural drawings. FloorPlanCAD text is Chinese and NC; WAFFLE's OCR output is pseudo-labels.
9. **VLM benchmarks are small and inherit restrictions.** AECV-Bench (120 plans) reuses CubiCasa5K and CVC-FP; FPBench-2K is announced but not released. Their protocols are reusable, their data is benchmark-only.

## 4. Datasets by Category

### 4.1 Vector CAD Drawings

These datasets label vector primitives and serve symbol spotting on DWGs. Rendered to raster, they could also train raster models, but their licences rule that out for production.

### 4.3 Vector Layouts and Graphs

Metric vector data with room types can be rendered in any graphical style, which matters more for BBL than building type. The Swiss Dwellings family is the only large permissive source.

| Dataset | Content and annotations | Format | Scale and building type | Licence | Access and status | Limitations | Relevance |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [Swiss Dwellings](https://zenodo.org/records/7788422) v3.0.0 | Areas with room types, walls, railings, columns, doors, windows and features (sanitary, kitchen) as WKT polygons in metres; unit usage residential, commercial, public, janitor; simulations\[101\] | CSV | Over 45,000 apartments (370,000 rooms) in ~3,100 buildings\[101\]; local copy: 3.26 M geometry rows, 13,905 floors, 3,184 buildings; Switzerland | CC BY 4.0\[101\] – P | Direct download (931.9 MB); in `data/public/`; no later version found | Sourced from Archilyse's commercial clients\[7\]; residential-dominated; geometry only, no drawing style or room stamps | High (licence-clean, Swiss, metric) |

### 4.4 Historical, Scanned and Style-Diverse Plans

Drawing-style shift is the dominant failure mode in the literature: a CubiCasa5K model scores door IoU 0.099 on WAFFLE ([literature review §2](literature-review.md#2-key-findings)). These sets test it.

| Dataset | Content and annotations | Format | Scale and building type | Licence | Access and status | Limitations | Relevance |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [WAFFLE](https://github.com/TAU-VAILab/WAFFLE) ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00955)) | Plan images with building type, country, Wikipedia text, OCR and grounded legends; dense segmentation labels on 110 images | Raster (+ SVG where available) | 18,556 plans; more than 1,000 building types and 100 countries, incl. historical and public buildings\[100\] | Code "under the Wikimedia Commons license"\[110\]; each image keeps its own Commons licence (public domain, CC0, CC BY, CC BY-SA) – U | SharePoint download\[110\]: anonymous access fails; a browser download omits the original images (size limit). In `data/benchmark/`: metadata, 1,208 SVG plans, the 110-image segmentation benchmark, OCR outputs | Labels mostly automatic; licence per image, not in the metadata (query Commons) | High (best public test for unseen styles) |
| [Versailles-FP](https://www.etis-lab.fr/versailles-fp/en/) ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.08064)) | Wall masks | Scans | 500 historical plans of the Château de Versailles, digitised by the VERSPERA project\[111\]\[113\] | "Academic usage of this dataset is free"; commercial use not addressed\[112\] – R | Agreement page; published at ICDAR 2021 | Walls only; one archive | Medium (historical wall test, via an academic partner) |
| Sapienza archive drawings | Semantic segmentation of analogue architectural drawings with hatch and texture conventions | Scans | Not stated | Release not stated – U | ISPRS Archives 2026\[137\] | Availability unknown | Low (contact the authors; hatched walls) |

CVC-FP (122 scans in 4 styles) and MLSTRUCT-FP (954 high-resolution plans) are listed in §4.2 and also serve as style tests.

### 4.5 BIM/IFC Models and Indoor Mapping

Cut and rendered as floor plans in randomised styles, IFC models give exact labels for walls, slabs, doors, windows, columns, stairs and spaces with names and numbers, in non-residential buildings. They are few, so they add diversity, not volume. Rendering creates a derivative, which rules out ND licences.

| Dataset | Content and annotations | Format | Scale and building type | Licence | Access and status | Limitations | Relevance |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [IFC-Bench](https://huggingface.co/datasets/sylvainHellin/ifc-bench) | 51 IFC models of 22 projects (architecture, structure, MEP); 1,027 QA pairs | IFC + JSON | Offices (several), dental clinic, hospital, hotels, residential\[118\] | QA CC BY 4.0; models keep their original licences, "majority … CC BY 4.0 or MIT", four GPLv3\[118\] – P (per model) | Hugging Face; 17 permissive models (CC BY 3.0/4.0, MIT) in `data/public/ifc-bench/` | Check each model's licence and origin; exclude the GPLv3 models; Schependomlaan is academic-only at its origin | High (non-residential render source) |

| [OpenStreetMap indoor](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Simple_Indoor_Tagging) | Rooms, corridors, doors and levels (Simple Indoor Tagging) | Vector | Sparse; mostly stations, malls, campuses | ODbL (not re-checked) – SA | Overpass or planet extracts | Uneven quality; no drawn walls | Low |

No Swiss federal or cantonal open dataset of indoor geometry was found.

### 4.6 Text in Drawings

Rules:
- The producer's licence applies; a mirror cannot grant more rights than its source.
- Where a producer contradicts itself (ResPlan, CVC-FP), apply the stricter reading until the producer confirms otherwise in writing.
- Record the producer's licence, URL and version in each dataset's `SOURCE.md` ([data/README](../data/README.md)).

## 6. Gaps

What no public dataset provides, and BBL has to build or label itself:
1. **Office, administrative and public-building plans with room stamps** under a permissive licence.
2. **Room-stamp text** (AOID or number, usage, area) in German, French and Italian with ground truth, and an OCR benchmark for drawings.
3. **Historical and hand-drawn plans** with structural labels under a usable licence. Versailles-FP is academic-only and labels walls only.
4. **Scans with exact vector ground truth** at scale. CVC-FP has 122 and is non-commercial.
5. **Gross floor area polygons, voids and SIA 416 area rules** as labels; ramps; stairs as flights.
6. **Column grids** outside non-commercial Chinese CAD data. Swiss Dwellings and MSD have columns, but in residential buildings.
7. **Swiss open indoor geometry** of any kind.

Compliant BBL DWGs ([pipeline §7](pipeline.md#7-training-data)), rendered IFC models and synthetic room stamps address the training gaps; the BBL gold set ([pipeline §8](pipeline.md#8-evaluation)) addresses evaluation.

## 7. Limitations of This Catalogue

- Not legal advice. NC, ND, research-only and eligibility clauses need an opinion from BBL's legal service before any use, benchmarking included.
- Rows marked "not re-checked" rely on papers or earlier catalogues. This applies to SESYD, FPLAN-POLY, RPLAN, Rent3D, R3D, R-FP, SydneyHouse, ROBIN, HouseExpo, Neufert 4.0, Structured3D, 3D-FRONT, HSSD, SceneCAD, opensourceBIM, OpenStreetMap indoor, Infinigen, ProcTHOR, and the 2026 benchmarks MMArch, ResPlan-FP and FloorPlan-VLN.
- Licences and availability are as found in October 2026 and will change: ArchCAD plans further releases, and LS-CAD and FPBench-2K are announced.
- Sizes are quoted as stated by the producers and differ between versions (§1).
- The search found no Swiss or German-language plan datasets, but national and cantonal archives were not searched systematically.
- Downloaded and inspected (October 2026): Swiss Dwellings v3.0.0, the fonts and 17 IFC-Bench models in `data/public/`; CubiCasa5K, CVC-FP, WAFFLE (partial) and a sample of Swiss plans from Wikimedia Commons in `data/benchmark/`. All other entries are based on their documentation.

## 8. Sources

- Shared [source list](papers/sources.md); numbers 101–140 were added for this catalogue.
- Papers: [research index](papers/README.md), especially the datasets group and the papers that introduced each benchmark; Markdown versions in `docs/papers/papers-md/` (local only).
- Local dataset records: [data/README](../data/README.md) and the `SOURCE.md` files in `data/public/`.
