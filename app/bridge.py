"""Access to the pilot v2 pipeline (package fpx) for the workflow app.

Everything the app needs from the pipeline goes through this module: the one path constant (PIPELINE_DIR), the lazy
model and OCR engine with clear errors when something is missing, and the three phases of a sheet
(docs/pipeline.md §3, "What runs at each step"):

    preflight(upload)                                    refuses an upload whose rasters would not fit in memory, from
                                                         the file header, before anything is decoded
    analyse(job_dir, upload, log)                        stage 0a normalisation, deskew, 1b layout: regions and drawings,
                                                         no OCR and no model (seconds)
    scale_step(job_dir, session, analysis, confirm,      stage 1c for the given drawings: OCR of the title block, the
               keys, log, doors=False)                   caption band and the drawing's area, scale bars; the door-width
                                                         search (the segmenter) only with doors=True. The server runs it
                                                         right after analyse() for the floor plans (their detected
                                                         areas), and again for an area the user changed
    prefetch_text(job_dir, session, analysis, confirm,   the text inside the selected drawings read into the OCR cache
                  keys, log)                             ahead of the extraction, while the user confirms (the server's
                                                         idle time); the extraction then skips its longest stage
    extract(job_dir, session, confirm, log, progress,    stages 2-10 per confirmed drawing inside its region at its scale,
            analysis=None)                               the OCR of the scale step and the prefetch reused from the cache

All three are fpx.pipeline.run_document on the same packages (kept in memory in the session; pickled next to the
job; the public server too while its worker processes need it): analyse() with stages=() and scale=False, scale_step() with stages=() and the OCR
bounded to boxes, extract() with the user's confirmations as `overrides` (confirmed region, scale, storey,
selection) and the same boxes.
